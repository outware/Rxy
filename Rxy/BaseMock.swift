/// Base class for mocks that provides the file and line where the mock was created. This results in
/// mocks reporting errors which would normally be buried wherever the mock is called, instead being reported
/// on the line in the test where the mock is created. This is very useful for debugging.
///
/// Here's an example of using this base mock:
/// ```
/// class MockThing: BaseMock, Thing {
///     var getCompletableResult: CompletableResult?
///     func getCompletable() -> Completable {
///         return mockFunction(returning: getCompletableResult)
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Visually it's little different to using the AsyncMock class directly. However when it's run, mock errors will be reported
/// On the line where the mock is declared, rather than the line where the mockFunction(...) call was made.
